# BSD 328: Simulation and Modelling Dashboard

## Description

A highly professional Streamlit dashboard built to solve Discrete Event Simulations (Queue management), Continuous Systems, Random Number Generation (LCG), and Statistical Data Analysis (Regression, Skewness, Kurtosis). This project provides a user-friendly interface for educational and practical simulation tasks.

## Features

- **LCG Generator:** Linear Congruential Generator for random number production and uniformity testing.
- **Bank Queue Simulator:** A simulation of customer arrivals and service times at a mobile-money desk using SimPy.
- **Network Speed Analyzer:** Statistical analysis tool for network data, including regression models and higher-order statistics (Skewness & Kurtosis).

## Setup Instructions

### Installation

Open your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
